## Task 1: Personalized Mentor Recommendation System  
### Step 1: Load Aspirant and Mentor Data  
- Define **aspirant profiles** with attributes like preferred subjects, target colleges, and learning style.  
- Define **mentor profiles** with expertise areas, alma mater, and teaching style.  

### Step 2: Process Feature Data  
- Convert text-based attributes using **TF-IDF vectorization**.  
- Normalize learning and teaching styles for compatibility.  

### Step 3: Compute Similarity & Recommend Mentors  
- Use **cosine similarity** to measure aspirant-mentor compatibility.  
- Extract **top 3 mentors** for each aspirant based on similarity scores.  

### Step 4: Implement Feedback System  
- Gather user ratings on mentor recommendations.  
- Adjust weights dynamically based on user feedback for better future recommendations.

## Task 2: Chatbot for Legal Exam Queries  
### Step 1: Build a Knowledge Base  
- Collect frequently asked CLAT-related queries and answers.  
- Store data in structured format for searchability.  

### Step 2: Develop Query Processing Logic  
- Use **keyword-based search** or **NLP techniques** (spaCy/NLTK) for response generation.  
- Identify relevant knowledge base entries for each user query.  

### Step 3: Implement Chatbot Interface  
- Develop a simple **Flask/Streamlit app** to handle user queries.  
- Provide conversational responses based on query matching.  

### Step 4: Scale the Chatbot  
- Integrate **GPT-based models** for improved responses.  
- Fine-tune on CLAT-specific data for enhanced query accuracy.

## Next Steps  
- Improve **recommendation accuracy** using real user feedback.  
- Expand chatbot capabilities for **better legal exam support**.  
- Deploy both systems as a **web application** for easy access.

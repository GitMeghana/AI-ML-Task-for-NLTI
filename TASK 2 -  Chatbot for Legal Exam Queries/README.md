# CLAT Chatbot – An NLP-Powered Legal Exam Assistant

## Overview
The CLAT Chatbot is an intelligent, NLP-powered assistant designed to help users with queries related to the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). Built using spaCy and NLTK, this chatbot can answer frequently asked questions, provide details on syllabus sections, explain the exam format, and share cutoff scores for law schools.

## Key Features
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Utilizes spaCy for tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
- Smart Query Matching – Uses keyword detection to retrieve relevant responses from a structured JSON dataset.
- Comprehensive Knowledge Base – Supports FAQs, syllabus details, exam format specifications, and cutoff information for law schools.
- Interactive CLI Chat System – A simple yet effective chatbot for real-time conversations.

## Repository Structure
```
clat_chatbot/
 ├── clat_data.json       # The structured knowledge base containing CLAT-related information.
 ├── clat_chatbot.ipynb   # Google Colab notebook with the chatbot implementation.
 ├── README.md            # Documentation outlining the chatbot's purpose and functionality.

## Installation and Setup

Before running the chatbot, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install spacy nltk
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Ensure that clat_data.json is available in your working directory.

---

## How It Works
1. User queries are processed using spaCy (lemmatization, stop-word filtering).
2. Keywords are extracted from user input to match relevant sections in the JSON dataset.
3. Responses are retrieved from FAQs, syllabus details, exam format, or college cutoff lists.
4. An interactive CLI-based chat allows users to engage in a real-time conversation.

## Supported Queries
Users can ask questions such as:
```
What is the CLAT exam format?
What is the cutoff for NALSAR Hyderabad?
Tell me about the syllabus for Logical Reasoning.
How is the marking scheme structured?
```
The chatbot will return the most relevant answer based on the dataset.

---

## Usage Instructions
To run the chatbot in Google Colab or locally:
```python
python clat_chatbot.ipynb
```
Once started, the chatbot will prompt users to ask CLAT-related questions. Users can type a question and receive an answer instantly.

To exit the chatbot, type:
```
exit
```
